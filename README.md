### To use this bot, create a .env file in the same directory as main.js

### Add 4 environment variables, TOKEN (your discord token), guildID (your server's ID), clientID (the bot's ID) and finally, whitelist (an array of user ID's that can use the /ac command.) Then run npm install

### Use npm start to start the bot.

#### (you're going to have to make your own API for the ac lol)
